  <b>I. <a NAME="general">GENERAL OVERVIEW</a></b><a NAME="general"></a>
  <p>The seeds of this mod were sown during a discussion on the merits of creating and publishing smaller mods
as an attempt to fuel further interest in Tutu modding, and to increase the likelihood of updating and
improving on said small mods.  The premise is that once you have something released, people will find things
that could be better, things that are wrong with it, and ways it could be expanded upon.  The creator can build
on that as time goes on.
<p>
The mod itself takes place in the coastal area south of Candlekeep, and involves the lighthouse, the treasure cavern,
the sirines dwelling along the beach, and worgs.  Also pirates.  Everyone loves pirates.  At the end of it all you
should have either a warm fuzzy feeling in your heart, or a bunch of loot.  This quest will especially appeal to druids,
though any class can play it without missing any content, dialogue, or equipment.
<p>
Explore the southern part of the lighthouse map (AR3600/FW3600.are) to start the quest.
<p>
From version 14, the mod is compatible with all BG1 games: Vanilla (classic) BG1:TotSC, Tutu (EasyTutu), BGT, BG:EE, and EET!
<p>
The optional component "Extended Lighthouse Area" replaces the area with a version without stones in front of the lighthouse entrance and adds doors that actually open. This component is not compatible with Tutu. By White Agnus.

  <p><a NAME="install"><b>II. INSTALLATION</b></a>

<br>General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)
Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 
Your game's main directory would be:
your main EasyTutu folder for EasyTutu
your main Tutu folder for Tutu
your main BGT folder for BGT.

To install the mod, follow the instructions:
  <ol>
    <li TYPE="i">Windows:<br>
On successful extraction, there should be a SirinesCall folder, a setup-sirinescall.exe and a setup-sirinescall.tp2 file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-sirinescall.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-sirinescall.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.
    <li TYPE="i">Mac OS X:<br>
Make sure you have the Mac OS X version of the mod. If properly extracted, you should have a SirinesCall folder, setup-sirinescall, and setup-sirinescall.command in your game's main directory folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bgqe.command and follow the instructions on screen.
    <li TYPE="i">Linux:<br>
Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from WeiDU.org and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
Run WeInstall setup-sirinescall in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.
  </ol>
  <p>Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be
  compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility
  for conflicts.&nbsp; We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official
  patches, Baldurdash, .tlk-based mods, and Tutu Fixpack.&nbsp;
  If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please send the file SETUP-SIRINESCALL.DEBUG
  to <a HREF="mailto:jastey@web.de">jastey@web.de</a>.
  <p><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>
  <p><a NAME="uninstall"><b>III. UNINSTALLATION for Windows</b></a>
  <p>Uninstalling is simple. Double-click the setup-sirinescall.exe file and enter the given commands for Uninstallation.<br>
  Afterwards, you may delete the following files:
  <ul>
    <li>setup-sirinescall.exe
    <li>setup-sirinescall.tp2
    <li>setup-sirinescall.debug
    <li>The &quot;sirinescall&quot; subfolder
  </ul>

  <p><a NAME="spoilers"><b>IV. SPOILERS</b></a>
  <p>Q: How <i>specifically</i> do I start the quest?<br>
  A: You start the quest by rescuing the little boy from the worgs at the lighthouse.  You can do this before or after talking to the boy's mother, Ardrouine.
  <p>Q: How do I side with the Old Man, instead of Sil?<br>
  A: If you're either charming enough or smart enough to convince the Old Man to confess, he'll... well, confess.  Then he'll offer to bribe you into killing Sil.
  <p>Q: What then?  Are there layers and layers of betrayal to this mod?  Can I be as nefarious and selfish as I truly desire?<br>
  A: Yes!  When you kill Sil, you can simply call it a day and get back to adventuring, or you can loot the cave the Old Man was searching for, and he'll follow you soon after.  Don't expect him to be happy, though.
  <p>Q: Does Safana have any interjections in this quest?<br>
  A: At present, no.  Expect some in the future, though.
  <p>Q: I can't find the lighthouse/cave/Sil/Ardrouine!  Where are they?<br>
  A: The lighthouse is in the south-west corner of the map.  Can't miss it.<br>
A: The cave is along the coast, around coordinates 400,950.<br>
A: Sil is just below the cave.  On your way to it, you'll meet her.<br>
A: Ardrouine is south-east of the lighthouse, almost on the very bottom edge of the map.  Follow the edge and you'll be sure to find her.
  <p>Q: How come I didn't get a reputation bonus for helping Sil?<br>
  A: How likely is she or her kind to spread word of your good deed?  Exactly.  If and when the Virtue mod has been expanded for Tutu content, expect a virtue gain for aiding Sil and her folk, however.
